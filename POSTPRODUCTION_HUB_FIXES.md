# Post-Production Hub - Major Fixes & Enhancements

## Date: October 10, 2025

## Overview
This document outlines the major fixes and enhancements made to the Post-Production Hub to resolve critical errors and improve the workflow for admins and editors.

---

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. **Fixed 404 Error on Editor "Start Work" Action**

#### Problem
- When editors clicked "Start Work" in the Editors Panel, the system threw a 404 error
- Frontend was calling: `PATCH /api/postprod/{jobId}/status`
- Backend didn't have this endpoint, causing the failure
- Error logs showed:
  ```
  INFO: 127.0.0.1:0 - "PATCH /api/postprod/kN4WSMviMFYKINKCqvQd%3Aphoto/status HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found
  ```

#### Root Cause
- Frontend used `jobId` format: `{eventId}:{stream}` (e.g., `kN4WSMviMFYKINKCqvQd:photo`)
- Backend only had endpoints at `/events/{event_id}/postprod/{stream}/start`
- Missing endpoint to handle status updates via jobId format

#### Solution
**File: `/backend/routers/postprod_assignments.py`**

1. Added new Pydantic model for status updates:
```python
class StatusUpdateRequest(BaseModel):
    to_status: Literal['IN_PROGRESS', 'REVIEW', 'REVISION', 'DONE']
    reason: Optional[str] = None
```

2. Created new endpoint `@router.patch('/{job_id}/status')`:
   - Parses `job_id` to extract `event_id` and `stream`
   - Validates user is assigned to the stream
   - For `IN_PROGRESS` status, verifies user is the LEAD editor
   - Updates stream state using existing state mapping logic
   - Records activity log
   - Returns updated status

3. Key features:
   - Supports status transitions: `IN_PROGRESS`, `REVIEW`, `REVISION`, `DONE`
   - Enforces role-based permissions (LEAD can start work)
   - Maintains activity history
   - Computes overall job status after state change

#### Impact
‚úÖ Editors can now successfully start work on assignments  
‚úÖ Status updates are properly tracked in activity logs  
‚úÖ System maintains data consistency across all streams

## üöÄ Major Feature Enhancements

### 2. **Data Assignment Integration with Editor Workflow**

#### Problem
- When admins assigned editors to events, there was no connection to the data collected by Data Managers
- Storage device information and approved submissions were not accessible to editors
- This caused:
  - Lack of traceability for which data belongs to which event
  - Editors had no visibility into storage locations
  - Difficulty in accessing the raw footage/data for editing
  - Manual coordination required between Data Managers and Editors

#### Solution
**Enhanced Multiple Backend Endpoints:**

##### A. Modified `/events/{event_id}/postprod/{stream}/assign` endpoint
**File: `/backend/routers/postprod.py`**

```python
# NOW INCLUDES:
intake_summary = job.get('intakeSummary') or {}

updates = {
    # ... existing fields ...
    f'{stream}.intakeSummary': intake_summary,  # Store at stream level
}

# Enhanced activity log
_record_activity(db, org_id, event_id, current_user.get('uid'), 'ASSIGN', 
                 stream=stream, 
                 summary=f"Assigned {len(editors_data)} editor(s) with data from {intake_summary.get('approvedCount', 0)} approved submissions")

# Return includes intake summary
return {'ok': True, 'status': status, 'version': version, 'intakeSummary': intake_summary}
```

##### B. Modified `/events/{event_id}/postprod/{stream}/reassign` endpoint
**File: `/backend/routers/postprod.py`**

Similar changes as assign endpoint to maintain consistency during reassignments.

##### C. Enhanced `_build_assignment()` function
**File: `/backend/routers/postprod_assignments.py`**

```python
# Get intake summary from stream state or job level
intake_summary = stream_state.get('intakeSummary') or job.get('intakeSummary') or {}

assignment = {
    # ... existing fields ...
    'intakeSummary': intake_summary,  # Include data manager approved submissions with storage info
    # ...
}
```

#### Data Structure: Intake Summary

The `intakeSummary` object now passed to editors contains:

```javascript
{
  approvedCount: 5,                    // Number of approved data submissions
  requiredCount: 5,                    // Total required submissions
  totalDevices: 12,                    // Total storage devices (CF cards, SSDs, HDDs)
  estimatedDataSizes: ["500GB", "1TB"], // Array of estimated data sizes
  approvedSubmissions: [               // Detailed submission info
    {
      submitterId: "user123",
      submitterName: "John Shooter",
      approvedAt: "2025-10-10T10:30:00Z",
      storageAssignment: {             // Storage location details
        storageMediumId: "storage456",
        storageMedium: {
          id: "storage456",
          type: "SSD",
          capacity: "2TB",
          room: "Storage Room A",
          cabinet: "C3",
          shelf: "S2",
          bin: "B5"
        },
        location: {
          room: "Storage Room A",
          cabinet: "C3",
          shelf: "S2",
          bin: "B5",
          additionalNotes: "Near the main entrance"
        },
        notes: "Handle with care - contains wedding footage",
        assignedAt: "2025-10-10T09:00:00Z",
        assignedBy: "dm_user789"
      },
      deviceCount: 3,
      estimatedDataSize: "500GB",
      handoffReference: "EVENT-2025-001-BATCH-A",
      notes: "All footage from main ceremony"
    }
    // ... more submissions
  ],
  recordedAt: "2025-10-10T11:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Benefits

‚úÖ **Full Traceability**: Editors can see exactly which data manager approved which data  
‚úÖ **Storage Location Access**: Physical location of all storage devices is available  
‚úÖ **Device Information**: Know what types of devices contain the footage (CF cards, SSDs, HDDs)  
‚úÖ **Estimated Data Sizes**: Plan disk space and workflows accordingly  
‚úÖ **Handoff References**: Track batch IDs for accountability  
‚úÖ **Submission Notes**: Context from shooters about footage content  
‚úÖ **Reduced Manual Coordination**: All information flows automatically through the system  
‚úÖ **Better Organization**: Admins can make informed assignment decisions

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Critical Test Cases

1. **Editor Start Work Flow**
   ```
   - Login as editor assigned to a job
   - Navigate to TeamDashboard ‚Üí My Jobs
   - Find assignment with status "ASSIGNED"
   - Click "Start Work"
   - Verify status changes to "IN_PROGRESS"
   - Check backend logs for successful PATCH request
   ```

2. **Data Assignment Flow**
   ```
   - Login as admin
   - Create/initialize post-production job for event with approved data submissions
   - Assign editors to photo/video streams
   - Login as assigned editor
   - View assignment details
   - Verify intakeSummary is present with:
     * Storage locations
     * Device information
     * Submitter details
     * Batch references
   ```

3. **Status Transitions**
   ```
   Test all status transitions:
   - ASSIGNED ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS (via Start Work)
   - IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí REVIEW (via Submit for Review)
   - REVIEW ‚Üí REVISION (admin requests changes)
   - REVISION ‚Üí REVIEW (resubmit after changes)
   - REVIEW ‚Üí DONE (admin approves)
   ```

4. **Permission Checks**
   ```
   - Verify only LEAD can start stream work
   - Verify ASSIST cannot change status to IN_PROGRESS
   - Verify non-assigned users cannot update status
   ```
