# Toast.info() Error Fix

## Error Description
```
TypeError: react_hot_toast__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_27__["default"].info is not a function
```

The application was crashing when trying to display distance information during check-in because `toast.info()` doesn't exist in the `react-hot-toast` library.

## Root Cause
The `react-hot-toast` library does not have a `toast.info()` method. The available methods are:
- `toast()` - neutral/default notification
- `toast.success()` - success notification (green)
- `toast.error()` - error notification (red)
- `toast.loading()` - loading notification
- `toast.promise()` - promise-based notification
- `toast.custom()` - custom notification

## Files Fixed

### 1. EnhancedGPSCheckIn.js (Line 323)
**Before:**
```javascript
if (data.distance) toast.info(`Distance from venue: ${data.venueDistance}`);
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (data.distance) toast(`Distance from venue: ${data.venueDistance}`);
```

### 2. GPSCheckInComponent.js (Line 157)
**Before:**
```javascript
toast.info(`You are ${data.venueDistance}`);
```

**After:**
```javascript
toast(`You are ${data.venueDistance}`);
```

### 3. SalaryRunDetails.js (Line 256)
**Before:**
```javascript
toast.info('After creating the index, please try again in a few minutes.');
```

**After:**
```javascript
toast('After creating the index, please try again in a few minutes.');
```

## Solution
Changed all occurrences of `toast.info()` to `toast()`, which displays a neutral notification with the default styling.

## Impact
- ✅ Check-in functionality now works without errors
- ✅ Distance information is displayed correctly
- ✅ No breaking changes to user experience
- ✅ Consistent toast notification styling

## Testing
1. Log in as a crew member
2. Navigate to an assigned event
3. Click "Check In" button
4. Grant location permission
5. Verify check-in completes successfully
6. Verify distance message appears (e.g., "You are 150m from venue")
