# Post-Production Enhancement Features - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented two major features to improve the post-production workflow:

1. **Storage Data Visibility for Editors** - Editors can now see detailed information about where event data is stored
2. **Deliverables Link Submission** - Editors can submit work links when submitting for review

---

## üéØ Feature 1: Storage Data Integration for Editors

### Problem Solved
Previously, when admins assigned editors to post-production jobs, editors couldn't see where the raw data (photos/videos) was physically stored. This required constant back-and-forth communication.

### Solution Implemented

#### Backend Changes (`postprod_assignments.py`)

**Enhanced `_build_assignment()` function:**
- Now fetches complete storage details from approved data submissions
- Retrieves batch information from Firestore `dataBatches` collection
- Includes storage location details (room, cabinet, shelf, bin)
- Lists all storage devices (type, brand, model, capacity, serial number)
- Returns structured `storageData` array with all relevant information

**Data Structure Added:**
```javascript
storageData: [
  {
    submitterId: "uid",
    submitterName: "John Doe",
    approvedAt: "2025-10-10T...",
    deviceCount: 3,
    estimatedDataSize: "500GB",
    handoffReference: "Locker 12",
    storageAssignment: "...",
    batchId: "batch123",
    physicalHandoverDate: "2025-10-08",
    storageMediumId: "SM-001",
    storageLocation: {
      room: "101",
      cabinet: "A",
      shelf: "2",
      bin: "5",
      additionalNotes: "..."
    },
    devices: [
      {
        type: "SD",
        brand: "SanDisk",
        model: "Extreme Pro",
        capacity: "128GB",
        serialNumber: "SN12345",
        notes: "..."
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

#### Frontend Changes (`TeamDashboardPage.js`)

**Added Storage Information Display:**
- New section in assignment cards showing all storage details
- Visual presentation with storage icon
- Color-coded borders for easy identification
- Shows:
  - Submitter information
  - Physical storage location (Room, Cabinet, Shelf, Bin)
  - Storage medium ID
  - Handoff reference
  - Device count and estimated data size
  - Individual device details (type, brand, model, capacity)

**UI Enhancement:**
```jsx
<Box sx={{ mt: 2, p: 2, bgcolor: 'background.default', borderRadius: 1 }}>
  <Typography variant="subtitle2">
    <StorageIcon /> Data Storage Information
  </Typography>
  {/* Storage details display */}
</Box>
```

## üéØ Feature 2: Deliverables Link Submission

### Problem Solved
Editors had no way to submit links to their completed work (Google Drive, Dropbox, WeTransfer, etc.). This forced them to use external communication channels, losing tracking and auditability.

### Solution Implemented

#### Backend Changes (`postprod_assignments.py`)

**Enhanced `update_job_status()` endpoint:**
- Now accepts `deliverables` parameter with work links
- Validates all URLs (must start with http:// or https://)
- Stores deliverables in Firestore under stream state
- Records submission metadata (timestamp, submitter info)
- Logs deliverable submission in activity feed

**Request Format:**
```javascript
PATCH /api/postprod/{jobId}/status
{
  "to_status": "REVIEW",
  "reason": "Submitted work for review",
  "deliverables": {
    "previewUrl": "https://drive.google.com/...",
    "finalUrl": "https://drive.google.com/...",
    "downloadUrl": "https://wetransfer.com/...",
    "additionalUrl": "https://...",
    "notes": "Optional submission notes"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```javascript
{
  "ok": true,
  "status": "REVIEW",
  "message": "Status updated to REVIEW",
  "deliverablesAccepted": true
}
```

**Firestore Updates:**
- `{stream}.deliverables` - Stores all submitted links
- `{stream}.lastSubmissionAt` - Timestamp of submission
- `{stream}.lastSubmittedBy` - UID of submitter
- `{stream}.lastSubmittedByName` - Display name of submitter

**Activity Logging:**
- Records submission in activity feed
- Includes deliverable count in summary
- Tracks status change from previous state

#### Frontend Changes (`TeamDashboardPage.js`)

**New State Management:**
```javascript
const [deliverablesModalOpen, setDeliverablesModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [selectedJobForDeliverables, setSelectedJobForDeliverables] = useState(null);
const [deliverableLinks, setDeliverableLinks] = useState({
  previewUrl: '',
  finalUrl: '',
  downloadUrl: '',
  additionalUrl: '',
  notes: ''
});
```

**Updated Submit Flow:**
1. Click "Submit for Review" button
2. Opens modal with deliverable link form
3. Fill in at least one URL (validation enforced)
4. Submit with proper error handling
5. Success toast and assignment refresh

**Modal Features:**
- Material-UI Dialog component
- 5 input fields (4 URLs + notes)
- Helpful placeholder text and helper text
- URL validation (client-side warning if invalid)
- Required field validation (at least one URL)
- Cancel button to close without submitting
- Success/error handling with toast notifications

**User Experience:**
- Clean, intuitive form layout
- Clear instructions
- Responsive design
- Proper error messages
- Automatic form reset after submission
- Instant visual feedback
