- date-fns for timestamp formatting
- React hooks for state management

**Props**:
```javascript
{
  jobData: {
    photo: {}, // Photo stream data
    video: {}, // Video stream data
    intakeSummary: {}, // Storage data
    eventName: string,
    clientName: string,
    currentUserUid: string
  },
  eventId: string,
  activityData: [], // Array of activity objects
  userRole: string
}
```

  }
  // else render admin view
  ```

#### 2. `frontend/src/App.js`

```
