# üéØ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED!

## ‚úÖ What We Discovered:

The `get_job()` endpoint is **extremely simple** - it just returns whatever is in the Firestore `postprodJob/job` document:

```python
async def get_job(event_id: str, ...):
    job_doc = job_document.get()
    if not job_doc.exists:
        # Initialize with defaults
        return payload
    data = job_doc.to_dict()
    return data  # ‚Üê Just returns Firestore data as-is!
```

**It doesn't compute `intakeSummary` at all!**

If the Firestore document doesn't have `intakeSummary`, it won't be in the API response.

Before we fix it, let's see what keys ARE in the job document:

### Expected Backend Output:
```
================================================================================
DEBUG: get_job called for event: RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J
================================================================================

INFO: 127.0.0.1:0 - "GET /api/events/.../postprod/overview HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

**After you click, tell me:**
- Do you see the debug message? (You should!)
- Any other debug output about "Job keys"?

---

## üìù Next Steps:

Once we confirm the debug is working, I'll add logic to:
1. Check if `intakeSummary` exists in job document
2. If missing, fetch the event document
3. Extract approved submissions from `dataIntake.submissions`
4. Build `intakeSummary` object
5. Save it back to Firestore
6. Return enriched job with `intakeSummary`

This is exactly what we tried to do before, but we were editing the wrong function!
