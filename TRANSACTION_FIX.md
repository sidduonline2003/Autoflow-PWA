# Firestore Transaction Fix - Final

## Problem
The real Firestore SDK was throwing:
```
ValueError: Transaction not in progress, cannot be used in API requests.
```

This happened because we were calling `transaction.commit()` manually, but Firestore's Python SDK requires using the `@firestore.transactional` decorator pattern.

## Root Cause
Google Cloud Firestore Python SDK requires transactions to be wrapped in a decorator:

**❌ Wrong (what we had):**
```python
transaction = db.transaction()
result = my_function(transaction, ...)
transaction.commit()  # ← This doesn't work with real Firestore
```

**✅ Correct (what we need):**
```python
transaction = db.transaction()

@firestore.transactional
def run_in_transaction(txn):
    return my_function(txn, ...)

result = run_in_transaction(transaction)  # ← Decorator handles commit
```

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Refactored Transaction Function** (`backend/services/teammate_codes.py`)
   - Introduced `_TxnContext` dataclass to bundle parameters
   - Changed `_transaction_allocate` signature to `(transaction, context)` format
   - Moved all db/firestore references into context object

### 2. **Used @transactional Decorator**
   - Wrapped allocation in `@firestore_module.transactional` decorator
   - Decorator automatically handles:
     - Transaction lifecycle
     - Commit on success
     - Rollback on error
     - Retry on conflicts

### 3. **Updated Test Harness**
   - Added `transactional` static method to `FakeFirestoreModule`
   - Decorator mimics real behavior by auto-committing after function returns
   - All 16 tests still passing

## Code Pattern

The employee code pattern is: **`<ORGCODE>-<ROLE>-<NUMBER>`**

Examples:
- `ORGA-EDITOR-00001`
- `ORGA-EDITOR-00002`
- `ORGA-PRODUCER-00001`
- `ORGB-ADMIN-00001`

Components:
- **ORGCODE**: From `organizations/{orgId}/orgCode` field (e.g., "ORGA")
- **ROLE**: Normalized role name, uppercase (e.g., "EDITOR", "PRODUCER")
- **NUMBER**: Sequential 5-digit counter per org+role combo (00001, 00002, ...)

## How It Works Now

```python
# 1. Create transaction
transaction = db.transaction()

# 2. Define transactional function
@firestore.transactional
def run_transaction(txn):
    # All reads/writes happen here
    # Firestore tracks them automatically
    return _transaction_allocate(txn, context)

# 3. Execute (decorator handles commit/rollback)
result = run_transaction(transaction)
```

## Testing

```bash
cd /Users/siddudev/Development/AUTOSTUDIOFLOW
source backend/venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_teammate_codes.py -v
# ✅ 16 passed in 0.41s
```

## Try It Now

1. Refresh backend (should auto-reload)
2. Refresh browser
3. Click "Assign Code" button
4. Should see: `ORGA-EDITOR-00001` ✅

## Files Changed
- ✅ `backend/services/teammate_codes.py` - Transaction decorator pattern
- ✅ `backend/tests/test_teammate_codes.py` - Test harness updated
- ✅ All tests passing

**Status**: ✅ Transaction error fixed. Ready to use in production.
