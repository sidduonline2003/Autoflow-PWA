# 🔥 DEBUG TEST - Do This NOW

## What I Just Added

### Backend (`postprod.py`):
```python
🔥🔥🔥 [OVERVIEW ENDPOINT CALLED] Event ID: RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J 🔥🔥🔥
```
This will print **IMMEDIATELY** when the overview endpoint is hit.

### Frontend (`AssignEditorsModal.jsx`):
```javascript
🔥🔥🔥 [AssignEditorsModal] LOADING STORAGE DATA - Modal opened! 🔥🔥🔥
```
This will print **IMMEDIATELY** when the modal loads storage data.

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Clear Your Browser Console
Press **F12** → Click **Console** tab → Click the 🚫 icon to clear old logs

### Step 2: Watch Both Terminals
- **Terminal 1**: Backend (uvicorn) - watch for `🔥🔥🔥 [OVERVIEW ENDPOINT CALLED]`
- **Terminal 2**: Browser Console (F12) - watch for `🔥🔥🔥 [AssignEditorsModal]`

### Step 3: Trigger the Modal
1. Navigate to your event page
2. Click **"Assign Photo Editor"** OR **"Assign Video Editor"** button
3. **The modal should open**

### Step 4: Check What You See

## 📊 What To Look For

### Scenario A: ✅ You See BOTH Fire Emojis

**Backend Terminal**:
```
🔥🔥🔥 [OVERVIEW ENDPOINT CALLED] Event ID: RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J 🔥🔥🔥
[POSTPROD DEBUG] get_job called for event: RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J
...more debug logs...
```

**Browser Console**:
```
🔥🔥🔥 [AssignEditorsModal] LOADING STORAGE DATA - Modal opened! 🔥🔥🔥
[AssignEditorsModal] Event ID: RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J
[AssignEditorsModal] Making API call to /events/RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J/postprod/overview
[AssignEditorsModal] API Response received: {...}
[AssignEditorsModal] Extracted intakeSummary: undefined or {...}
```

**✅ GREAT!** Both frontend and backend are communicating. 
- If intakeSummary is still undefined, share the full backend debug output

---

### Scenario B: ❌ You See Frontend Fire, NO Backend Fire

**Browser Console**:
```
🔥🔥🔥 [AssignEditorsModal] LOADING STORAGE DATA - Modal opened! 🔥🔥🔥
[AssignEditorsModal] Making API call to /events/RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J/postprod/overview
❌ [AssignEditorsModal] Failed to load storage data: Error: ...
```

**Backend Terminal**:
```
(nothing - no fire emoji)
```

**❌ PROBLEM**: Frontend is trying to call API but not reaching backend.

**Possible Causes**:
1. API base URL is wrong
2. CORS error blocking request
3. Auth token invalid/expired
4. Network error

**Check**:
- Look for **red errors** in browser console Network tab
- Check if backend is running on correct port
- Verify frontend API config

---

### Scenario C: ❌ NO Fire Emoji in Frontend Console

**Browser Console**:
```
(nothing - no fire emoji)
```

**❌ PROBLEM**: Modal is not calling the storage loading useEffect.

**Possible Causes**:
1. Modal not actually opening
2. `eventId` is undefined/null
3. Frontend bundle not rebuilt
4. React StrictMode calling effect twice (check for duplicates)

**Action**: 
1. Check if modal UI appears on screen
2. Look for ANY `[AssignEditorsModal]` logs
3. Rebuild frontend: `npm run build` or refresh hard (Cmd+Shift+R)

---

### Scenario D: ❌ You Only See Activity Endpoint Logs

**Backend Terminal**:
```
INFO: 127.0.0.1:0 - "GET /api/events/RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J/postprod/activity HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
(no fire emoji)
```

**❌ PROBLEM**: Wrong endpoint is being called, or modal not opening.

**Action**:
- Make sure you're clicking **"Assign Editor"** button (not something else)
- Check if modal actually opens visually
- Verify frontend code is using correct endpoint

---

## 🔍 What to Share With Me

Copy/paste **EVERYTHING** you see:

1. **Full backend terminal output** when you click the button
2. **Full browser console output** when you click the button
3. **Screenshot** of the modal if it opens

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The frontend bundle needs to be rebuilt if you're using production build
- If using dev server (npm start), changes should be instant
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R) if needed
- Make sure backend server is running

---

## 🎯 Expected Result

When everything works, you should see:

**Backend**:
```
🔥🔥🔥 [OVERVIEW ENDPOINT CALLED] Event ID: RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J 🔥🔥🔥
[POSTPROD DEBUG] get_job called for event: RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J
[POSTPROD DEBUG] Job has intakeSummary: False
[POSTPROD DEBUG] Event data loaded successfully
[POSTPROD DEBUG] Number of submissions: 2
[POSTPROD DEBUG] ✅ Setting computed summary as intakeSummary
[POSTPROD DEBUG] Final intakeSummary has 2 approved submissions
```

**Frontend**:
```
🔥🔥🔥 [AssignEditorsModal] LOADING STORAGE DATA - Modal opened! 🔥🔥🔥
[AssignEditorsModal] Event ID: RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J
[AssignEditorsModal] Making API call to /events/RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J/postprod/overview
[AssignEditorsModal] API Response received: {intakeSummary: {...}}
[AssignEditorsModal] Extracted intakeSummary: {approvedCount: 2, approvedSubmissions: [...]}
```

**UI**: Storage data section appears with checkboxes for each approved submission
