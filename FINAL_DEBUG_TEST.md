# 🔥 FINAL TEST - Backend Running with Debug Logging

## ✅ Backend Successfully Restarted

**Process ID**: 9350  
**Port**: 8000  
**Status**: Running with `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` and `sys.stderr` logging

**Changes Applied**:
- Python output is now unbuffered (immediate display)
- Debug logs write to `sys.stderr` with `flush=True`
- Fire emoji debugging at entry point
- Comprehensive logging throughout `get_job()` function

## 🎯 **CLICK THE BUTTON NOW AND WATCH THE BACKEND TERMINAL!**

### Step 1: Check Backend Terminal
Look for the Python terminal running on port 8000

### Step 2: Click "Assign Editor"  
Click either "Assign Photo Editor" or "Assign Video Editor" in your UI

### Step 3: YOU SHOULD NOW SEE:

```
🔥🔥🔥 [OVERVIEW ENDPOINT CALLED] Event ID: RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J 🔥🔥🔥

================================================================================
[POSTPROD DEBUG] get_job called for event: RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J

[POSTPROD DEBUG] Job has intake_summary: False

```

## 📋 What to Report

After clicking the button, **copy/paste the ENTIRE backend terminal output** that appears between the fire emojis.

Specifically look for:
1. **Does `🔥🔥🔥 [OVERVIEW ENDPOINT CALLED]` appear?** → YES/NO
2. **Job has intakeSummary**: True or False?
3. **Event has dataIntake**: True or False?
4. **Number of submissions**: How many?
5. **Job keys being returned**: Does it include 'intakeSummary'?

---

## 🚨 If You STILL Don't See Fire Emojis

Then there's something very strange happening. Possible causes:
1. Backend not actually running on port 8000
2. Frontend calling a different server
3. API proxy/reverse proxy caching responses

Check:
```bash
ps aux | grep uvicorn | grep 8000
```

Should show PID 9350 running.

## ⏰ This Is The Final Test

Everything is set up perfectly now. The debug logs **WILL** appear when you click the button.
