# 🔧 Equipment 404 Issue - FIXED!

## Problem
Frontend was getting **404 Not Found** when calling `/api/equipment`

## Root Causes Found

### 1. ❌ Wrong Router Imported
**Issue:** `main.py` was importing the old `equipment` router instead of the new `equipment_inventory` router

**Location:** `/backend/main.py` line 16

**Before:**
```python
from .routers import ..., equipment, ...
```

**After:**
```python
from .routers import ..., equipment_inventory, ...
```

And line 52:
```python
# Before
app.include_router(equipment.router, prefix="/api", tags=["Equipment Management"])

# After
app.include_router(equipment_inventory.router, prefix="/api", tags=["Equipment Management"])
```

---

### 2. ❌ Missing Dependencies
**Issue:** Backend was missing required Python packages

**Packages Installed:**
```bash
pip install 'qrcode[pil]' pillow nanoid
```

**Required for:**
- `qrcode` - QR code generation
- `pillow` - Image processing for QR codes
- `nanoid` - Generating unique asset IDs

---

### 3. ❌ Trailing Slash Mismatch
**Issue:** FastAPI registered routes with trailing slash `/api/equipment/` but frontend was calling `/api/equipment` (no slash)

**Location:** `/frontend/src/services/equipmentApi.js`

**Fixed Routes:**
```javascript
// Before
getAll: (params) => api.get('/api/equipment', { params }),
create: (data) => api.post('/api/equipment', data),

// After
getAll: (params) => api.get('/api/equipment/', { params }),
create: (data) => api.post('/api/equipment/', data),
```

## ✅ Verification

Test the endpoint:
```bash
# With auth - should return equipment list
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/equipment/

# Without auth - should return 401
curl http://localhost:8000/api/equipment/
# Response: {"detail": "Not authenticated"}
```

## 🎯 Current Status

**Backend:**
- ✅ Server running on http://localhost:8000
- ✅ Equipment router loaded (`equipment_inventory.py`)
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Routes responding correctly

**Available Equipment Routes:**
- `GET /api/equipment/` - List all equipment
- `POST /api/equipment/` - Create equipment
- `GET /api/equipment/{asset_id}` - Get equipment details
- `PATCH /api/equipment/{asset_id}` - Update equipment
- `DELETE /api/equipment/{asset_id}` - Retire equipment
- `POST /api/equipment/checkout` - Checkout equipment
- `POST /api/equipment/checkin` - Checkin equipment
- `GET /api/equipment/checkouts` - Get checkouts

**Frontend:**
- ✅ API service updated with trailing slashes
- ✅ Auth token automatically injected via interceptor
- ✅ Ready to test in browser

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test in Browser:**
   - Login as admin
   - Navigate to Equipment Dashboard
   - Should load equipment list from backend

2. **Test Create Equipment:**
   - Click "Add Equipment"
   - Fill form and submit
   - Should create equipment and show QR code

3. **Test My Equipment (Teammate):**
   - Login as teammate
   - Navigate to My Equipment
   - Should show your checkouts
