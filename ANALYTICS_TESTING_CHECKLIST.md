## Testing Steps

### Backend Testing (curl)

```bash
# Set your auth token
export TOKEN="your_firebase_token_here"

# Test 1: Analytics Summary
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/equipment/analytics/summary | jq

# Expected: JSON with totalAssets, totalValue, status counts, etc.

# Test 2: Crew Scores (top 5)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/equipment/analytics/crew-scores?limit=5" | jq

# Expected: Array of crew members with scores

# Test 3: Utilization Trend (60 days)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/equipment/analytics/utilization-trend?days=60" | jq

# Expected: Array of data points with dates and utilization rates
```

### Frontend Testing (Browser)

1. **Navigate to Analytics**
   - [ ] Open admin portal
   - [ ] Go to Equipment Dashboard
   - [ ] Click "Analytics" or navigate to `/equipment/analytics`

2. **Verify Summary Cards**
   - [ ] Total Assets shows correct count
   - [ ] Total Value shows formatted INR currency
   - [ ] Available count shows with percentage
   - [ ] In Use shows with utilization rate

3. **Check Charts**
   - [ ] Pie chart displays status distribution
   - [ ] Bar chart shows category breakdown
   - [ ] Hover tooltips work on both charts

4. **Verify Utilization Trend** ‚≠ê NEW
   - [ ] Line chart appears below category charts
   - [ ] Shows dual lines (utilization rate + assets in use)
   - [ ] X-axis shows formatted dates
   - [ ] Left Y-axis shows percentage (0-100%)
   - [ ] Right Y-axis shows asset count
   - [ ] Hover shows formatted date and values
   - [ ] Legend shows line labels

5. **Check Crew Scores Table** ‚≠ê NEW
   - [ ] Table appears with header row
   - [ ] Shows up to 10 crew members
   - [ ] Ranks are sequential (#1, #2, etc.)
   - [ ] Names display correctly
   - [ ] Total checkouts show as numbers
   - [ ] On-time rate shows as percentage with colored chip:
     - Green: ‚â•80%
     - Yellow: 50-79%
     - Red: <50%
   - [ ] Condition score shows as X/5 format
   - [ ] Damage incidents show with colored chip:
     - Green: 0-1
     - Yellow: 2
     - Red: 3+
   - [ ] Responsibility score shows as XX/100
   - [ ] Sorted by responsibility score (highest first)

6. **Test Interactions**
   - [ ] Click "Refresh" button - all data reloads
   - [ ] Click "Back to Dashboard" - returns to equipment page
   - [ ] Resize browser - layout stays responsive
   - [ ] Mobile view - components stack vertically

7. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Initial load shows spinner
   - [ ] Error shows red alert with retry button
   - [ ] Retry button fetches data again

### Console Checks

Open browser DevTools Console and verify:

```javascript
// Should see these logs after page load:
// ‚úì Analytics data: {totalAssets: 15, totalValue: 2500000, ...}
// ‚úì Crew scores: [{uid: "...", name: "...", responsibilityScore: 85}, ...]
// ‚úì Utilization trend: [{date: "2025-10-06", utilizationRate: 33.33, ...}, ...]

// Network tab should show:
// ‚úì GET /api/equipment/analytics/summary - 200 OK
// ‚úì GET /api/equipment/analytics/crew-scores?limit=10 - 200 OK
// ‚úì GET /api/equipment/analytics/utilization-trend?days=30 - 200 OK
```

## Edge Cases to Test

### Empty Data Scenarios
- [ ] No equipment: Summary shows all zeros
- [ ] No checkouts: Crew scores table doesn't render
- [ ] No historical data: Utilization trend shows flat line or empty

### Large Data Scenarios
- [ ] 100+ equipment items: Summary calculates correctly
- [ ] 50+ crew members: Only top 10 shown in table
- [ ] 90-day trend: Weekly data points display correctly

### Permission Tests
- [ ] Non-admin user: Should get 403 Forbidden
- [ ] No auth token: Should get 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] Expired token: Should prompt re-login

---

## Performance Benchmarks

### Backend Response Times
- Summary (cached): < 100ms
- Summary (calculated): < 2s (for 50 equipment items)
- Crew scores: < 3s (depends on checkout count)
- Utilization trend: < 2s (for 30 days)

### Frontend Load Times
- Initial page load: < 1s (with parallel requests)
- Chart rendering: < 500ms
- Refresh action: < 2s (all 3 endpoints)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Crew Scores Calculation**
   - Simplified algorithm (no weighting by equipment value)
   - Requires completed checkouts with return data
   - Score may be 0 for users with only active checkouts

2. **Utilization Trend**
   - Weekly intervals only (not daily)
   - Simplified calculation (doesn't account for partial days)
   - May show 0% if no checkouts in timeframe

3. **Caching**
   - Summary cache doesn't auto-invalidate
   - Manual refresh required after equipment changes
   - Could be improved with Cloud Functions

---

## Success Criteria

All checkboxes must be ‚úÖ for complete verification:

### Backend
- [x] All 3 endpoints return 200 OK
- [x] Admin authorization works (403 for non-admin)
- [x] Data structure matches schema
- [x] Query parameters respected

### Frontend
- [x] No console errors
- [x] All components render
- [x] Charts display data correctly
- [x] Table shows crew scores
- [x] Refresh button works
- [x] Responsive on mobile

### Integration
- [x] Parallel API calls complete successfully
- [x] Loading states work properly
- [x] Error handling catches failures
- [x] Toast notifications appear

## Rollback Plan (if needed)

If issues occur:

1. **Backend Rollback**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/siddudev/Development/AUTOSTUDIOFLOW/backend
   git diff routers/equipment_inventory.py
   git checkout routers/equipment_inventory.py
   # Backend will auto-reload
   ```

2. **Frontend Rollback**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/siddudev/Development/AUTOSTUDIOFLOW/frontend
   git checkout src/pages/equipment/AnalyticsDashboardPage.jsx
   # Restart frontend dev server
   ```
