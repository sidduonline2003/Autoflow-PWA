# 🔍 DEBUGGING THE DATA STRUCTURE

## ✅ What We Found:

**Good News:**
- ✅ The code IS running!
- ✅ Found 1 submission in event data
- ✅ Trying to compute intakeSummary

**The Problem:**
```
DEBUG: Error computing intakeSummary: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'
```

This means the `submissions` data structure is different than expected!

---

## 🛠️ What I Fixed:

Added detailed logging to see what the actual data structure looks like:

```python
print(f"DEBUG: Submissions type: {type(submissions)}")
print(f"DEBUG: First submission type: {type(submissions[0])}")
print(f"DEBUG: First submission sample: {submissions[0]}")

for idx, sub in enumerate(submissions):
    if isinstance(sub, dict):
        # Process dict
    elif isinstance(sub, str):
        # Log string case
    else:
        # Log unexpected type
```

### Expected Debug Output:

```
================================================================================
DEBUG: get_job called for event: RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J
DEBUG: Has intakeSummary: False
DEBUG: intakeSummary missing, computing from event data...
DEBUG: Found 1 submissions in event
DEBUG: Submissions type: <class 'list'>
DEBUG: First submission type: <class 'str'> or <class 'dict'>
DEBUG: First submission sample: {...actual data...}
DEBUG: Submission 0 is a string: ... OR processed successfully
================================================================================
```

## 📋 What to Share:

**Copy ALL the DEBUG lines**, especially:
- `DEBUG: Submissions type:`
- `DEBUG: First submission type:`
- `DEBUG: First submission sample:`

This will show us the EXACT data structure so we can fix the parsing!

---

## 🎯 Possible Scenarios:

1. **Submissions is a string (JSON)** → Need to parse JSON first
2. **Submissions is array of strings** → Need to parse each string
3. **Submissions has different field name** → Need to check structure
4. **Submissions is array of arrays** → Need nested access
