## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Backend Delete Endpoints**

#### Single Equipment Delete
```python
DELETE /api/equipment/{asset_id}
```
- Deletes equipment document
- Removes all checkout history
- Removes all maintenance records
- Deletes QR code from Firebase Storage
- **Protection:** Cannot delete if equipment is checked out

#### Bulk Equipment Delete
```python
POST /api/equipment/bulk-delete
Body: ["CAMERA_1", "LENS_2", "AUDIO_3", ...]
```
- Deletes up to 500 items at once
- Returns success/failure count
- Skips checked-out items automatically
- Provides detailed error list

### 2. **Frontend UI Updates**

#### Checkbox Selection
- ☑️ Checkbox in each table row
- ☑️ "Select All" checkbox in header
- ☑️ Indeterminate state when partially selected
- ☑️ Disabled checkboxes for checked-out items

#### Delete Button
- Appears only when items are selected
- Shows count: "Delete (5)"
- Red color to indicate destructive action

#### Confirmation Dialog
- ⚠️ Warning icon and message
- Shows exactly what will be deleted
- Lists affected data (history, QR codes, etc.)
- Shows count of skipped checked-out items
- Requires explicit confirmation

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Selection Flow:
```
1. User checks equipment checkboxes
2. "Delete (n)" button appears
3. User clicks Delete button
4. Confirmation dialog opens
5. User confirms deletion
6. Backend deletes items
7. Success toast shows result
8. Equipment list refreshes automatically
```

### Protection Logic:
```javascript
// Items that CANNOT be deleted:
- Equipment with status: "CHECKED_OUT"

// Items that CAN be deleted:
- AVAILABLE equipment
- MAINTENANCE equipment
- MISSING equipment  
- RETIRED equipment
```

## 🐛 Error Handling

### Backend Errors:
```python
# 403 Forbidden
"Admin access required"

# 404 Not Found  
"Equipment CAMERA_abc123 not found"

## 🔄 Cleanup Process

When equipment is deleted, the system removes:

1. **Equipment Document** (`organizations/{orgId}/equipment/{assetId}`)
2. **Checkout History** (`equipment/{assetId}/checkouts/*`)
3. **Maintenance Records** (`equipment/{assetId}/maintenance/*`)
4. **QR Code** (`organizations/{orgId}/qr_codes/{assetId}.png`)
