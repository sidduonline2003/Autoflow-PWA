## Setup Instructions

### 1. Ola Maps API Configuration

#### Get API Key
1. Visit [Ola Maps Developer Portal](https://developers.olamaps.io/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Generate a new API key for your application
4. Enable the following services:
   - Geocoding API
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API

#### Configure Environment Variables
Create or update your environment configuration:

**Frontend (.env):**
```bash
REACT_APP_OLA_MAPS_API_KEY=your_ola_maps_api_key_here
```

**Backend (.env):**
```bash
OLA_MAPS_API_KEY=your_ola_maps_api_key_here
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

#### Install Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### Add Ola Maps Script to Public HTML
Add to `frontend/public/index.html`:
```html
<head>
  <!-- Other head content -->
  <script src="https://api.olamaps.io/tiles/v1/styles/default-light-standard/sprite.js"></script>
  <script>
    window.OlaMaps = {
      apiKey: '%REACT_APP_OLA_MAPS_API_KEY%'
    };
  </script>
</head>
```

#### Update Build Configuration
Ensure your build process replaces environment variables in the HTML template.

### 3. Backend Setup

#### Install Additional Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
pip install requests aiohttp
```

Update `requirements.txt`:
```txt
# Existing dependencies...
requests==2.31.0
aiohttp==3.9.1
```

#### Configure Firestore Indexes
Add to `firestore.indexes.json`:
```json
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "collectionGroup": "attendance",
      "fields": [
        {"fieldPath": "eventId", "order": "ASCENDING"},
        {"fieldPath": "checkInTime", "order": "ASCENDING"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "attendance",
      "fields": [
        {"fieldPath": "userId", "order": "ASCENDING"},
        {"fieldPath": "eventId", "order": "ASCENDING"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Deploy indexes:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

### 4. Location Permissions Setup

#### Browser Permission Handling
The system automatically handles location permission requests with:
- Permission status detection
- User-friendly error messages
- Guidance for enabling location services
- Graceful fallback for denied permissions

#### Mobile App Considerations
For mobile app deployment:
- Add location permissions to app manifests
- Implement background location tracking (if needed)
- Handle location permission edge cases

### 5. Event Venue Configuration

#### Coordinate Format
Events should include venue coordinates in one of these formats:

**Option 1: Embedded Coordinates**
```
Venue Name, City (17.4065,78.4772)
```

**Option 2: Address-based (with Ola Maps geocoding)**
```
123 Main Street, Hyderabad, Telangana, India
```

#### Database Structure
Event documents should include:
```javascript
{
  name: "Event Name",
  venue: "Venue Name, City (17.4065,78.4772)",
  date: "2025-07-08",
  time: "10:00",
  assignedCrew: [
    {
      userId: "user123",
      name: "Team Member Name",
      role: "Lead Photographer"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage Guide

### üì± For Team Members

#### Check-in Process
1. **Open Event Dashboard**: Navigate to Team Dashboard ‚Üí GPS Check-in tab
