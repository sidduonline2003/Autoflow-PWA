# Admin UI Enhancements - Post-Production Portal

## Overview
Enhanced the admin post-production portal to display deliverable URLs and storage device information, making it easier for admins to review editor submissions and manage assignments.

---

## 🎯 Feature 1: Deliverable URLs in Activity Feed

### Problem Solved
When editors submitted work for review with deliverable links, admins could only see "Submitted work for review" in the activity feed but couldn't see or click on the submitted URLs. This required checking elsewhere or asking editors for the links.

### Solution Implemented

**File: `ActivityFeed.jsx`**

**Enhanced ActivityRow Component:**
- Detects when activity kind is 'SUBMIT' and has deliverables
- Displays all submitted URLs in an expandable, highlighted section
- Shows: Preview URL, Final URL, Download URL, Additional URL, and Notes
- All URLs are clickable and open in new tab
- Beautiful visual presentation with color-coded box

**Visual Presentation:**
```jsx
📎 Submitted Deliverables:
  Preview: https://drive.google.com/...
  Final: https://drive.google.com/...
  Download: https://wetransfer.com/...
  Notes: All shots color-graded in 4K
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Clickable URLs that open in new tabs
- ✅ Color-coded highlight box (primary color border)
- ✅ Shows all deliverable types
- ✅ Displays editor's submission notes
- ✅ Proper spacing and typography

---

## 🎯 Feature 2: Deliverables in StreamCard

### Problem Solved
Admin couldn't see the submitted deliverables directly in the photo/video stream cards. They had to scroll through activity feed to find submission links.

### Solution Implemented

**File: `StreamCard.jsx`**

**Enhanced StreamCard Component:**
- Shows deliverables prominently when available
- Green-highlighted box with success theme
- Displays all submitted URLs with labels
- Shows submission timestamp
- Truncates long URLs for better readability

**Visual Presentation:**
```jsx
📎 Submitted Deliverables
  Preview: https://drive.google.com/...
  Final: https://drive.google.com/...
  Download: https://wetransfer.com/...
  Notes: Ready for review
  Submitted: Oct 10, 2025 3:45 PM
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Success-themed green box (indicates work completed)
- ✅ All URLs are clickable
- ✅ Smart URL truncation (shows first 50 chars + ...)
- ✅ Submission timestamp
- ✅ Editor's notes prominently displayed
- ✅ Positioned between editors list and action buttons

---

## 🎯 Feature 3: Storage Data in Assignment Modal

### Problem Solved
When assigning editors, admins couldn't see where the raw data (photos/videos) was stored. They had to check separately before assigning, making the workflow inefficient.

### Solution Implemented

**File: `AssignEditorsModal.jsx`**

**Enhanced Assignment Modal:**
- Fetches and displays storage/intake data from job overview
- Shows all approved data submissions
- Displays storage locations (Room, Cabinet, Shelf, Bin)
- Lists device information and data sizes
- Shows handoff references
- Provides context about data availability

**Visual Presentation:**
```jsx
💾 Data Storage Information (2 approved submissions)
This data was collected and approved by the Data Manager.
Editors will see this information in their assignments.

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ John Doe                            │
│ Devices: 3 • Data Size: 500GB      │

│ Location: Room 102, Shelf 1, Bin 3 │
│ Reference: Cabinet B                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

📋 Summary: 5 total devices • 500GB, 300GB
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Auto-loads when modal opens

- ✅ Device count and estimated sizes
- ✅ Complete storage locations

## 📚 Code Examples

### Activity Feed Enhancement:
```jsx
// Check if this is a submission with deliverables
const hasDeliverables = item.kind === 'SUBMIT' && item.deliverables;

// Display deliverable URLs if present
{hasDeliverables && (
  <Box sx={{ mt: 1, ml: 18, p: 1.5, bgcolor: 'action.hover' }}>
    <Typography variant="caption" fontWeight="bold">
      📎 Submitted Deliverables:
    </Typography>
    {/* Render all URLs */}
  </Box>
)}
```

### StreamCard Enhancement:
```jsx
{/* Display Deliverables if present */}
{data?.deliverables && Object.keys(data.deliverables).length > 0 && (
  <Box sx={{ my: 2, p: 1.5, bgcolor: 'success.light' }}>
    <Typography variant="subtitle2">
      📎 Submitted Deliverables
    </Typography>
    {/* Render URLs */}
  </Box>
)}
```

### Assignment Modal Enhancement:
```jsx
// Fetch storage data
React.useEffect(() => {
  (async () => {
    const res = await api.get(`/events/${eventId}/postprod/overview`);
    const intakeSummary = res.data?.intakeSummary;
    setStorageData(intakeSummary);
  })();
}, [eventId]);

// Display storage data
{storageData && storageData.approvedSubmissions?.length > 0 && (
  <Box sx={{ mt: 2, p: 2, bgcolor: 'background.default' }}>
    {/* Render storage info */}
  </Box>
)}
```

## 🎓 Developer Notes
