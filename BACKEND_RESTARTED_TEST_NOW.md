# 🔥 BACKEND RESTARTED - Test Again Now!

## ✅ What Just Happened

**Problem Identified**: The backend server was running **OLD CODE** even though we added all the debug logging!

**Solution Applied**: 
- Killed the old uvicorn process (PID 1312)
- Started fresh backend server (PID 7706)
- Server is now running with ALL our debug code

## 🎯 What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Refresh Your Browser
Press **Cmd + Shift + R** (hard refresh) to clear any cached frontend code

### Step 2: Open Browser Console
Press **F12** → Console tab → Clear it (🚫 icon)

### Step 3: Click "Assign Editor" Button Again
- Click either "Assign Photo Editor" or "Assign Video Editor"
- Watch BOTH terminals:
  - **Backend terminal** (should show fire emojis now!)
  - **Browser console**

## 🚨 If Still No Debug Logs

If you STILL don't see the backend debug logs after restarting:

1. **Check if backend is actually running**:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep uvicorn | grep -v grep
   ```
   You should see PID 7706

2. **Check backend terminal directly** - it should be in the Python terminal tab

3. **Make sure you're testing the right event** - RXfDWUy8SvICkkQVzi0J

## 📝 What to Report

After clicking "Assign Editor" again, copy/paste:

1. **All backend terminal output** (especially the debug logs)
2. **Browser console logs** (the fire emoji section)
3. Tell me if you see the fire emoji in backend now (YES/NO)

---

## ⏰ This Should Take 30 Seconds

1. Refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R) - **5 seconds**
2. Click "Assign Editor" - **2 seconds**  
3. Copy backend logs - **10 seconds**
4. Paste here - **10 seconds**

**DO IT NOW!** The backend is finally running the correct code! 🚀
