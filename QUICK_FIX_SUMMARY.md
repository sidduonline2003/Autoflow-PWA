# Quick Fix Summary - Backend Server Startup Error

## Issue
Backend server was failing to start with ImportError:
```
ImportError: cannot import name '_compute_overall_status' from 'backend.routers.postprod'
```

## Root Cause
The actual `backend/routers/postprod.py` file on disk was missing several critical helper functions that `postprod_assignments.py` was trying to import:
- `_record_activity()`
- `_compute_overall_status()`
- `_require_admin()`
- `_load_job()`

These functions existed in the editor snapshot but were not saved to the actual file.

## Solution
Added the missing functions to `backend/routers/postprod.py`:

1. **`_record_activity()`** - Records activity logs for post-production jobs
2. **`_compute_overall_status()`** - Computes the overall status of a job based on stream states
3. **`_require_admin()`** - Validates admin permissions
4. **`_load_job()`** - Loads a post-production job from Firestore

## Result
✅ Backend server now starts successfully  
✅ All imports work correctly  
✅ No more ImportError  
✅ Server running on http://127.0.0.1:8000  

## Files Modified
- `/backend/routers/postprod.py` - Added 4 missing helper functions

## Next Steps
The previously implemented features should now work:
1. Editors can click "Start Work" without 404 errors
2. Data assignment integration is functional
3. Frontend can communicate with backend properly

## Testing
To verify everything works:
1. Backend server is running ✅
2. Navigate to TeamDashboard as an editor
3. Try clicking "Start Work" on an assignment
4. Verify the request succeeds (no 404 error)
